# A Practical Guide to Large Language Models (LLMs) — Strengths & Best Uses

This post compares major LLM families (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini/PaLM, Meta Llama, Mistral, Falcon/MPT, and other alternatives), explains their strengths and weaknesses, and recommends which to choose for chat assistants, code, RAG, on-device inference, and cost-sensitive workflows.

## Why this guide
- Inputs: You need to pick an LLM for a concrete task (chatbot, summarization, code assistant, RAG, or self-hosting).
- Outputs: Short list of recommended models, strengths/weaknesses, example prompts, and a quick decision checklist.

## Model-by-model guide

### OpenAI — GPT-4 / GPT-3.5

#### Strengths
- Best-in-class instruction following, reasoning, and code generation.
- Rich SDKs, plugins, and production-ready tooling.

#### Weaknesses
- Higher cost and vendor lock-in.
- Data residency and privacy concerns for sensitive data.

#### Best uses
- Production chat assistants that need tool use and high reliability.
- High-quality summarization, content generation, and RAG generation.
- Code completion, refactoring, and developer tooling.

#### Example prompt
"Summarize the following text in 5 bullets focusing on action items and risks:"

```
The product launch was delayed three weeks due to supplier shortages. The engineering team recommends increasing vendor redundancy and adding a safety stock. Marketing timelines will shift and customer communications must be prepared. The finance team should review budget for expedited shipping options.
```

| Cohere / Aleph Alpha | Embeddings & multilingual | Embeddings, classification | Low-Medium | Medium | Yes | No/limited | Provider alternatives with unique strengths |

> Notes: "Latency" and "Cost" are generalizations — actual values depend heavily on hosting, model size, and usage pattern.

## Choosing by task (concise)
- Chat & reasoning: GPT-4 or Claude 3; self-hosted option — Llama 3 with RAG.
- Code assistants: GPT-4 (best), or fine-tuned Llama/Mistral for on-prem.
- RAG & long-docs: Use models with long-context support or combine embeddings + RAG with a strong generator (GPT, Claude).
- Cost-sensitive bulk generation: GPT-3.5 or quantized Llama/Mistral/Falcon.
- Multimodal: Gemini or OpenAI multimodal variants.
- On-device/privacy: Quantized Llama, Mistral, Falcon with llama.cpp/ggml or vLLM.

## Quick decision checklist
1. Data sensitivity: must data stay on-prem? If yes → self-host (Llama/Mistral/Falcon).
2. Budget per request: high → GPT-4; low → GPT-3.5 or quantized open models.
3. Latency requirements: low-latency → smaller/quantized models near users.
4. Integration needs: plugins/tools → OpenAI has richest ecosystem.
5. Multimodal requirements: Gemini or OpenAI multimodal models.
6. Need to fine-tune: prefer open weights (Llama family, Mistral) or providers with fine-tuning APIs.

## Practical prompts (examples)

- Summarization: "Summarize the following text in 5 bullets focusing on action items and risks:"

```text
The product launch was delayed three weeks due to supplier shortages. The engineering team recommends increasing vendor redundancy and adding a safety stock. Marketing timelines will shift and customer communications must be prepared. The finance team should review budget for expedited shipping options.
```

- Classification (few-shot): "Label the sentiment of these examples (POS/NEG/NEUTRAL). Return JSON array of labels."

    Example (few-shot input):

    ```text
    Example 1: "I love the new update — the UI is so much cleaner and faster!"
    Example 2: "The product crashed three times today. Very disappointing experience."
    Example 3: "The feature works as expected; nothing surprising either way."
    ```

    Prompt instruction: "Label the sentiment of the examples above as POS, NEG, or NEUTRAL and return a JSON array of labels in the original order."

    Expected output (example):

    ```json
    ["POS", "NEG", "NEUTRAL"]
    ```

- RAG assistant: "Given the retrieved documents below and the user question, provide a concise answer and cite document IDs used."

    Example (retrieved docs + question):

    ```text
    [DOC_1] Title: Supplier report
    Content: "Supplier A reported delays in shipments for component X due to raw material shortages."

    [DOC_2] Title: Engineering notes
    Content: "Team recommends increasing vendor redundancy and maintaining a two-week safety stock."

    User question: "Why was the product launch delayed and what should we do next?"
    ```

    Prompt instruction: "Answer concisely using the retrieved documents. Cite the document IDs (e.g., DOC_1, DOC_2) used for each statement."

    Example expected answer:

    ```text
    The launch was delayed due to supplier shortages for component X (DOC_1). Recommended next steps: increase vendor redundancy and maintain a two-week safety stock to mitigate future delays (DOC_2).
    ```

- Code explanation: "Explain the following Python function in simple terms and suggest two tests for edge cases:"

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return True if n is a prime number, otherwise False."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        i += 1
    return True
```

## Operational checklist (engineering)
- Start with a small POC to measure latency, cost, and hallucination rates.
- For self-hosting, test quantized inference on your target hardware before committing to a model.
- Add monitoring for hallucination, latency, and user satisfaction.

## Caveats
- Hallucination: All LLMs can hallucinate — use RAG/verification for critical outputs.
- Safety: Add guardrails and human review for high-risk outputs.
- Licensing: Check open-model licenses before commercial use.
