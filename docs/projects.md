### Potential Talent Hunt
> Description:
> 	Built an end-to-end AI-driven talent search and ranking system using modern ML and MLOps practices. Implemented a FastAPI backend with semantic search powered by FAISS and sentence transformers, enabling high-performance vector similarity search. Developed an interactive Gradio GUI for user querying and result visualization. Containerized the application with Docker and deployed it to AWS ECS (Fargate) using a Docker Hub image, supporting scalable REST endpoints and production-grade serving. Led exploratory data analysis and model experimentation in Jupyter notebooks, including embedding workflows and ranking logic making use of FastAPI, FAISS, sentence-transformers, Gradio, Docker, AWS ECS, Python, vector search, NLP.
###  Term desposit subscription 
> Description:
> 	Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict term-deposit subscriptions, achieving ~96% model accuracy using CatBoost after evaluating multiple classification algorithms. Performed full data preprocessing, cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering. Optimized model performance through cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm comparison. Generated actionable feature-importance insights to identify key customer behaviour drivers and support targeted marketing strategies. Conducted statistical analysis and customer segmentation to discover high-conversion customer groups and improve marketing decision-making.  Delivered a reproducible workflow with modular, well-documented Python code, supporting scalability and future deployment

### Classification using deeplearning  
> Description:
> The non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup wants to create an algorithm to predict whether or not applicants for funding will be successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.
