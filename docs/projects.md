# Here are some of the projects done as part of post grad course at University of Birmingham / mentorship program (DSAAMP) at condanics & as resident engineer at APZIVA:

### Customer behaviour prediction in a logistics/delivery domain
> Description:
> Developed a machine learning solution to predict customer satisfaction for a logistics startup, improving prediction accuracy to ~73% by performing data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and model optimization using scikit-learn, and delivering insights that enhanced customer retention strategies.
> project details/code can be found in my github repository https://github.com/nawazyarkhan/EvG0OxbGO4xst3Jp

### Personal portfolio using mkdocs  
> Description:
> Created my portfolio website using python framework mkdocs.
> project details/code can be found in my github repository **https://github.com/nawazyarkhan/myportfolio**

### Sample portfolio using DJANGO  
> Description:
> Created my sample portfolio website using python framework DJANGO.
> project details/code can be found in my github repository **https://github.com/nawazyarkhan/nykPortfolio**

### Local LLM to help answer user questions from provided text/PDF/doc files
> Description:
>   Created RAG based app using Ollama model llama3 that takes test/PDF/doc file as an input
>   using streamlit GUI.
>   Details can be found under github repository **https://github.com/nawazyarkhan/localRAG_AI**


### Classification using deeplearning 
> Description:
> The non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup wants to create an algorithm to predict whether or not applicants for funding will be successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.

### comparison of various classification algorithms 
> Description:
> This is a comparison of different classification algorithms (decision tree, random forest, XGBoost) performance using the diamonds dataset from seaborn.
> Details/code can be found under github repository **https://github.com/nawazyarkhan/classification_algorithms_comparison**


### Credit risk evaluator using logistic regression & random forest
> Description:
> This project involves analyzing and predicting a provided dataset of loan applicants to evaluate & predict the risk involved in loan approval.
